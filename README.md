Hi there! My name is Elias Gottsbacher, but you can call me Gotzi or GodGotzi. I'm a 18-year-old student at HTBLA Kaindorf Austria with a passion for programming and a wide range of hobbies. When I'm not coding, you can find me playing volleyball, racing RC 1:8 cars, or gaming.

Speaking of programming, I'm well-versed in several languages. C/C++, Python, Rust and Java are my bread and butter. I'm also proficient in Kotlin and Javascript/Typescript.

I'm always looking to improve my coding skills and learn new things. If you're interested in collaborating on a project or just want to chat about programming, feel free to reach out to me on Github. I'm excited to see what we can create together!
